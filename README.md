PycoHTTP
========
Super minimal "pico sized" python HTTP server (or API interface)

## Only supports:
* 1 request at a time, no concurrency
* Only GET requests
* Does NOT serve files (or anything) by default
* Responses are defined via a Python callback

# Purpose:
* Adding minimal web interfaces to Python apps.

# Why do this?
* For learning purpouses
* To use in my projects
